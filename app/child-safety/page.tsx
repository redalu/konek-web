            <ul className="privacy-list">

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Automated tooling:</strong> we may employ automated content
                classification tools (such as image and text classifiers) to surface
                potentially harmful uploads for human review. We also evaluate
                industry-standard hash-matching against known CSAM databases as the
                platform grows.

                <strong>Behavioral signals:</strong> account-creation patterns,
                friending patterns, and reporting velocity are monitored to identify
                accounts that may be predatory; suspicious accounts are escalated
                to our reviewers.
